# MCQ_Quiz_using JS

## Description

- Personal-work: Created a coding quiz using HTML, CSS, JS.
- This challenge emphasized the use of JavaScript to provide questions and collect user inputs to determine whether the answer is correct or wrong. There is a timer decreasing gradually unless the user chooses the wrong input. Every wrong input deducts some time from the main timer. The final score is the user's score.
- This project helped me to learn more about how to use logic in JavaScript and different types of API uses.
 
## Installation

To run the application successfully, we need Microsoft Visual Studio as an editor, Git Bash to clone the github repo and Chrome Dev Tools to inspect the code.

## Task 

-	HTML and CSS is used to design the interface.
-	JavaScript documents helped to create the coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.
-	This homework emphasized the importance of using JavaScript web APIs to make dynamic changes to an HTML document.
-	Different event listeners and functions were implemented for user convenience.
